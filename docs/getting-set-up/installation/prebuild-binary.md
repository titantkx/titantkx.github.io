# 📁 Prebuild binary

<!-- {% hint style="warning" %} -->
This guild uses Ubuntu. You will need knowledge about the linux shell.
<!-- {% endhint %} -->

Instead of installing `titand` from the source code, the validator can use our prebuild binary to use it instantly.

## Download prebuild from github

Find the latest release at [https://github.com/titantkx/titan/releases](https://github.com/titantkx/titan/releases) and download a suitable version for your machine.

Example: download v2.0.1 version for Linux with AMD processor

```sh
https://github.com/titantkx/titan/releases/download/v2.0.1/titan_2.0.1_Linux_amd64.tar.gz
```

Extract to the folder you wanted

```sh
mkdir ~/titan
tar -xzf titan_2.0.1_Darwin_amd64.tar.gz -C ~/titan
```

After extraction, the folder structure will be like this. It will contain binary `titand` and shared library `libwasmvm`

```sh
.
├── LICENSE.md
├── README.md
├── bin
│   └── titand
└── lib
    ├── libwasmvm.aarch64.so
    ├── libwasmvm.dylib
    └── libwasmvm.x86_64.so
```

At this point, you can easily run the program

```sh
~/titan/bin/titand version --long
```

You should get output like this

```sh
build_tags: netgo,ledger,cgo
commit: 
cosmos_sdk_version: v0.47.6
go: go version go1.20.6 darwin/amd64
name: titan
server_name: titand
version: 2.0.1
```
